His work focuses on R4D of remote sensing (RS) and geospatial solutions for large-scale crop disease early warning systems, whereby he explores the potential of UAV-based high-throughput phenotyping for biotic stresses and satellite-based crop disease detection. 
                        <br> 
                        Overall, Gerald has 13 years of research and consultancy experience in (inter)national projects in the agriculture and development sectors of several countries (e.g. Australia, China, Ethiopia, Germany, Mexico, and the UK). As a researcher, he developed RS and GIS tools for precision and conservation agriculture, digital soil mapping, and environmental monitoring during his Post-Doc (Newcastle University, UK) and Ph.D. studies (GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Germany), and consultancy activities (CIMMYT, Mexico). For instance, to optimize farm management, Gerald developed an easy-to-use tool for deriving yield zones in crop production system by applying Spatio-temporal analysis to large yield map time series using image analysis techniques such as pattern recognition and unsupervised learning. As a GIS expert (GIZ German agency of international cooperation, Germany; SEMARNAT, Mexico) he built and managed a GIS for waste management for the Mexican Federal Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT).

                    <p align="justify"> 
                        Wheat rusts pose a major threat to food security in Ethiopia, with several devastating epidemics in recent history. To help prevent major disease outbreaks, early detection and timely control are essential. In response to the wheat rust problem in Ethiopia, a consortium of national and international partners have created one of the most advanced, operational crop disease early warning and advisory systems in the world. This early warning system includes several advanced technologies and operates in near real-time within the wheat season. Key elements include near real-time field and mobile phone surveillance data, mobile nanopore sequencing diagnostics, meteorologically-driven spore dispersal, disease environmental suitability forecasting, and a platform for timely communication to policy-makers, extension agents and small-holder farmers. This keynote talk describes the existing early warning system and the planned development of additional, new components for enhancement based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and remote sensing, such as UAV-based high throughput phenotyping for biotic stresses.

                    <p align="justify">
                        The unprecedented destruction of tropical forest cover has serious negative consequences on the regulation of the world’s climate cycle, biodiversity and other environmental variables. With rising global temperatures, improved forest monitoring, especially at the landscape scale has become increasingly important.  Because forest changes manifest at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, effective monitoring will likely require an integrated approach, where detailed community-based in-situ observations are combined with remote sensing satellites. With these considerations in mind, this presentation will describe an integrated community based tropical forest monitoring system which combines emerging technologies, remote sensing and community-based observation in support of REDD+ monitoring, reporting and verification implementation.

                        Epidemiology sits at an intersection of a number of different disciplines and uses techniques from, for example, the fields of health, medicine, statistics and geography.  Although the importance of the geographical component has historically been understood, interdisciplinary approaches to epidemiology and spatial analysis, where each discipline contributes and advances, are still a rarity. A number of geographical limitations impact epidemiological analysis, such as inconsistent geography, data scale/resolution, health and population data issues. In terms of epidemiological research, exposure misclassification, selection and ecological bias, rare diseases and confounding impact study design and methods. Combining the lessons learnt from both disciplines with advanced statistical approaches enables advances in both. In a world where epidemiology has gone from an almost unknown discipline to being a part of our everyday language and lives, due to COVID-19, this talk will explore the importance of the relationship between epidemiology and the geographical perspective.

                    <p align="justify">
                        In this workshop, we will cover how to access the air pollution data collected by the TROPOMI orbital sensor on Google Earth Engine, with an emphasis on nitrogen dioxide measurement, which has been used in many media examples as a proxy for mapping the intensity of activities during pandemic and lockdown periods. Nitrogen dioxide is strongly associated with urban activities and the burning of fossil fuels, such as diesel oil and also industrial activities, and analysing its temporal space distribution can give some interesting indications about human activities and their intensity on the Earth's surface.

                    <h4 style="color: #FFCD03; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">WORKSHOP: <br> Disease Risk Modeling and Visualization using R-INLA </h4> 
                    <p align="justify">
                        Disease risk models are essential to inform public health and policy. These models can be used to quantify disease burden, understand geographic and temporal patterns, identify risk factors, and measure inequalities. In this workshop we will learn how to estimate disease risk and quantify risk factors using aerial and geostatistical data. We will also create interactive maps of disease risk and risk factors, and introduce presentation options such as interactive dashboards. We will work through two disease mapping examples using data of malaria in The Gambia and cancer in Pennsylvania, USA. We will cover the following topics:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Model disease risk in different settings</li>
                        <li>Manipulate and transform point, areal and raster data using spatial packages</li>
                        <li>Retrieve high resolution spatially referenced environmental data using the raster package</li> 
                        <li>Fit and interpret spatial models using <a href="http://www.r-inla.org/" target="_blank"> <i class="icon fa-link"></i> Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA)</a> </li>
                        <li>Map disease risk and risk factors using <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/" target="_blank"> <i class="icon fa-link"></i> leaflet </a> and <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank"><i class="icon fa-link"></i> ggplot2 </a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The workshop examples will focus on health applications, but the approaches covered are also applicable to other fields that use georeferenced data including ecology, demography or the environment. The workshop materials are drawn from the book 'Geospatial Health Data: Modeling and Visualization with R-INLA and Shiny' by Paula Moraga (2019, Chapman & Hall/CRC).</p>
