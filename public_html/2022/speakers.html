                    <p class= "keynote-content">The importance of reducing methane emissions to mitigate climate change in the short term has been recognised at the highest 
                        political level. At COP26 over 100 countries signed up to the Methane Pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. The International Methane
                         Emission Observatory (IMEO) was recently launched by the UN to support companies and governments in reducing their methane emissions by providing 
                         actionable data based on a.o. methane measurements. In addition, the European Commission has prominently identified the role of satellites to support
                          its goal to reduce methane emissions. In this presentation I will present the state-of-the-art on satellite observations of so-called methane super
                           emitters, and how this can help reduce the emissions of this important greenhouse gas.

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                         Our planet is in dire straits. Several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals address problems resulting from climate change and rising greenhouse gas emissions. The constant growth of urban mobility and transport has led to a dramatic increase in these emissions. In order to ensure livable environments for future generations, it will be necessary to reduce our CO2 footprint. Spatial decision-making fueled by spatial data science contributes to this effort in major ways, supported by recent progress regarding the availability of spatial big data, computational methods and geospatial technologies. This presentation will demonstrate why spatial decision-making is essential for sustainability and how spatial data science provides methods to perform large-scale spatio-temporal analyses of mobility patterns as well as geospatial technologies for changing people's mobility behavior. Examples will cover movement data analysis within the context of multi-modal and energy-efficient mobility, smart charging of electric vehicles, and mobile decision-making support.

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        Since the 2010s there has been a shift in the nature and quantity of digital data on social processes flowing into both research and policy. Much of this data stems from sensing and monitoring through GIS and related technologies, whether using people themselves as sensors (as with mobile phone location data) or using classic forms of sensing in new ways (such as satellite data for migration monitoring, or social media data for development policy). New forms of data such as those stemming from fintech, from ID systems around the world, and other sources promise to broaden the uses and potential abuses of people’s digital traces. The new data provides what Pentland (2012) has termed ‘the god’s eye view’ – but to whose benefit, and in whose interests? There are two views on this in the world of research. First, do the new sources provide better-quality data, do they add something to the analysis of social phenomena, can they enable policy and research to do a better job of serving society? The second view asks how these data sources become available, whose interests they serve, and what this means for their legitimacy, and the legitimacy of research and policy based on them. This presentation will explore the tensions between these two views, and ask how these new sources of geospatial data interact with questions of rights, ethics and politics.

                    <p class= "keynote-content">Replicability takes on special meaning when researching phenomena that are embedded in space and time, 
                        including phenomena distributed on the surface and near-surface of the Earth. Two principles, spatial dependence and spatial
                         heterogeneity, are generally characteristic of such phenomena. Various practices have evolved in dealing with spatial heterogeneity, 
                         including the use of place-based models. I review the rapidly emerging applications of artificial intelligence to phenomena distributed
                          in space and time, and speculate on how the principle of spatial heterogeneity might be addressed. I introduce a concept of weak
                           replicability and discuss possible approaches to its measurement.

                <p class= "keynote-content">Over the past decade, I have been trying to identify, understand, and specify a small set of Core Concepts of Spatial Information. 
                    These concepts are intended to be necessary and sufficient for understanding how spatial information answers questions about the world.
                    I started researching them around 2010, when I faced two problems—and embarrassments—at once: First, I could not come up with contents
                    that seemed compelling and worth teaching in a graduate course on Geographic Information Science. Second, I found it much harder than 
                    expected to help an epidemiologist improve his GIS model of how bird flu spreads among turkey farms in northern Italy. Both problems
                    indicated to me a need for clarifying and strengthening the conceptual foundations of GIS. In my presentation at GeoMundus, I will 
                    summarize the research results so far and suggest that the core concepts have the potential to make learning and using GIS easier,
                     more platform-independent, and more generally accessible. Through their systematic anchoring in physics and ontology 
                     (without compromises or “adaptations” to supposedly special needs of GIS) they can contribute to a future where spatial 
                     information and spatial computing are as well understood and applicable across disciplines as statistical information and computing are today.

                    <p class= "keynote-content">Deep learning for automated detection of archaeological sites (objects)
                         on earth observation data is a highly novel field. The key challenge of this field is in the 
                         inherent nature of the objects; they occur in small numbers, are sparsely located, and feature
                          a unique pattern on the different remote sensing data modalities. I will introduce how we have
                           alleviated these challenges by using specialised Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 
                           optimising training regimes. We quickly iterate through optimisations in small areas and work 
                           closely with domain experts to remove common false positives and thus reach a high level of accuracy before scaling the solution to large, in some cases national, datasets.

                    <p  style="text-align: justify;">GeoAI within ArcGIS has taken advantage of the wider availability of cloud computing, and now is being applied in a wide range of organizations in variety of fields. This is matched by strong growth in the imagery industry thanks to increased satellite data, countries seeking to provide publicly accessible aerial imagery, and the massive market availability of commercial drones. In this workshop we demonstrate cloud imagery storage and analysis with ArcGIS in interesting GeoAI in sectors like Agriculture, Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Response, Development and Urban planning, and more. We will explore the different products that are GeoAI enabled and will work with the different deep learning resources available in the ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World. The attendees of this workshop will learn how to go through a deep learning workflow. We will take a close look at creating training data, training new models, fine-tuning existing models and inferencing within ArcGIS. Finally we cover post processing and data sharing workflows within ArcGIS.</p>

                        Businesses worldwide are using artificial intelligence (AI) to solve their greatest challenges. Healthcare
                        professionals use AI to enable more accurate, faster diagnoses in patients. Retail businesses use it to
                        offer personalized customer shopping experiences. Automakers use it to make personal vehicles, shared
                        mobility, and delivery services safer and more efficient. Deep learning is a powerful AI approach that
                        uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to deliver state-of-the-art accuracy in tasks such as object
                        detection, speech recognition, and language translation. Using deep learning, computers can learn and
                        recognize patterns from data that are considered too complex or subtle for expert-written software.</p>

            </h4> 
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                Ecosystem services (ES) are the benefits provided to humans by the natural environment, such as clean air, natural pollination, drought regulation, food from agriculture, climate regulation, etc. Providing Information about ES for decision-making is essential to preserve their supply and, consequently, their benefits to society. Making these services visible through the mapping of biophysical, social and economic indicators enables understanding of potential trade-offs and the design of conservation strategies. The provision of ES is influenced by land cover changes (LCC) and efficient land use planning is required for maintaining ES flow. Land use planning can be supported by ES-based modelling tools to estimate ES supply based on land cover. In this workshop we explore available open data and models which can be used for ES modelling and mapping. A hands-on exercise using an InVEST model will be carried out.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                This workshop will provide a perspective on existing open datasets and models to work with ES. It will also promote the importance of the ecosystem services concept for sustainability and human well-being through the results obtained for FCT ASEBIO project (PTDC/CTA-AMB/28438/2017, https://asebio.novaims.unl.pt). In the end of this workshop, participants will:
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand the ES concept and its importance for human well-being;</li>
                    <li>Know where to find open datasets and models (e.g. InVEST) for assessing ES with GIS;</li>
                    <li>Learn how to calculate ES indicators using InVEST.</li>
                </ul>
