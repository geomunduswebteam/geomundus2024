# GeoMundus Conference 2021 - Website Repository
The GeoMundus Conference is a free international conference organized by students of the joint MSc program in Geospatial Technologies. Since 2009, the GeoMundus has been hosted annually alternating between the program’s organizing universities, NOVA IMS (Lisbon, Portugal), WWU (Münster, Germany) and UJI (Castellón de la Plana, Spain).

The conference brings together students, researchers, and professionals from the broader geospatial community for a unique collaborative experience. The aim is to share state of the art scientific research, knowledge, and skills in the fields of Geospatial Technologies, Geoinformatics, and Geosciences.
