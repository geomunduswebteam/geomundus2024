Her research interests are at the intersection of sustainable development and spatial inequities of access in rapidly urbanizing areas in the world. Between 2006-2015 she was a Preceptor for Geospatial Methods at Harvard University, Cambridge MA, USA where she has taught courses on spatial models and GIS. She is affiliated with the Center for Geographic Analysis and the China Project at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard where she also was a postdoctoral fellow. The methodological lens that she uses in her research is spatial analysis: the use of GIS, remote sensing, statistical and spatio-temporal models. She has studied transportation, land use, energy use and infrastructure in cities in India, China and the US.

Currently, he's working at Direc&ccedil;&acirc;o Geral de Recursos Naturais, Seguran&ccedil;a e Servi&ccedil;os Mar&iacute;timos, in the local implementation of the SNIMar project, the Portuguese Spatial Data Infrastructure for the Sea. Before, he worked at a cartography company called Turinta and, more recently, at Cascais Ambiente, a municipal environmental agency, where he worked in developing the municipal Green Infrastructure. In all cases, his work was always related to spatial analysis, spatial databases management, cartography and design. In 2011, he started to get interested by the Open Source Software trend and, step by step, started to address his everyday GIS tasks using exclusively Open Source Software. Since then, Alexandre Neto has become a impassioned Open Source advocate. He is a Charter member of the OSGeo Foundation, a founder member of the Portuguese QGIS User Group and the author of the open source dedicated blog "GIS Unchained".
