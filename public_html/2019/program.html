                                            Throughout history, location has played a key role in the development and progress of people and societies.

                                            During this session, HERE will show how are they focused on the concept of location and the potential it has to radically improve the way we do business, the way we get around and the way we live, shaping the future by redefining what was formerly known as a map.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            We will discover anecdotes and curiosities about mapping technology: From the beginning, when they started digitizing maps to pioneer in-car navigation systems, to the present, representing living three-dimensional maps that grow upwards, breathing with layers of information and insights.
                                        </p>

                                            This representation of reality will maximize the possibilities of the different industries to create services and developments that enable people and objects to move, interact and live faster, safer and in a more efficient way than ever before.

                                        who have work together to merge diverse disciplines such as cartography, topography, design or IT technologies. Far from the big audiences, GIS have been watching the mainstream IT progress from certain distance,
                                        making us wonder what was special about spatial. Now, this trend seems to have changed. IT mainstream has realized the power of maps, and any IT technology is looking into maps for flashy visualizations, smart analysis,

                                            <br>
                                            Satellite images are valuable sources to monitor the changes happening in the earth's surface patterns as well as dynamics. However, the analyses of such images often require a long series of remotely-sensed data. In two hands-on sessions, we first cover the use of the R package RGISTools to facilitate the handling of satellite images time series from major satellite programs, such as Landsat, MODIS, and Sentinel, covering in a comprehensive manner the retrieval, and customizing and processing satellite images. Having retrieved and processed satellite images time series of e.g. land surface temperature (LST) and/or vegetation indices from MODIS, we then review some of the most considered change-point and trend detection methods, and make use of them to discuss the areas where have faced changes over time together with the corresponding time of change for some provinces/cities in Europe.
