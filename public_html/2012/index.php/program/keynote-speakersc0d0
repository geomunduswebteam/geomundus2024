He moved to Spain in 1991 to join ESRI Spain as director of technology transfer. He was a visiting GIS professor in Madrid and Extremadura before taking a permanent position as professor of information systems in 1999 at Universitat Jaume I (UJI) in Castellon. In 2000-2001 he spent a sabbatical year at the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) in Boston. He has been principal investigator in a number of European and national research projects, and was one of the co-founders of the Erasmus Mundus Masters degree in Geospatial Technologies. In 2008 he joined ESRI (California) as Global Education Manager and is now based in Spain, where he works only part-time at UJI. In his ESRI role he travels extensively and works with ESRI offices, ministries of Education and local universities --mostly in Middle East, Africa and Latin America-- to improve the level of GIS education, training, and employment.</p>
