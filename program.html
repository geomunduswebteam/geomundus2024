                                                <br>
                                                <b>Abstract:</b> The launch of GRASS GIS in 1984 marked the beginning of open-source geospatial software.
                                                After four decades, this talk highlights major progress in the field and provides a vision of upcoming trends.
                                                FOSS4G developers need to find a middle ground between standardisation and innovation. Whether de facto or de jure,
                                                standards establish a solid foundation for shared use and collaboration. Solid theory serves as the basis for
                                                successful standards. OGC’s Simple Features, using DE-9IM, has influenced the success of PostGIS, sf in R, and
                                                GeoPandas in Python. The backbone of GDAL includes standards like GeoTIFF and JPEG 2000. Thanks to these standards,
                                                commercial and institutional users have widely adopted tools like PostGIS, GDAL, and R-sf.

                                                for promoting free access for geospatial data and for setting up an efficient satellite monitoring of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest.
                                                After retiring from INPE in June 2016 after 35 years of work, he continues to conduct R&D activities at INPE as a Senior Research Fellow.

                                                from the University of the Azores, where she developed expertise in using geospatial technologies and SAR data for volcanic scenarios
                                                in islands. She is currently pursuing a PhD in Engineering and Management of the Natural Environment at the Polytechnic University of Madrid.
                                                Her research focuses on detecting land use and land cover changes in small oceanic islands, employing remote sensing techniques to assess
                                                environmental impacts and inform conservation efforts.

                                                across diverse global contexts. Participants will gain insights into practical applications of geospatial data and tools in addressing
                                                humanitarian crises, sustainable development, and managing resources effectively. Additionally, current trends, challenges, and future

                                                Abstract: Satellite data are critical for a wide range of environmental applications. In the past, access to satellite data was limited to researchers and professionals with expertise in remote sensing and image processing. However, with the increasing availability of open-access satellite data and cloud-computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine, Microsoft Planetary Computer, and Amazon Web Services, anyone can now gain insight into environmental changes on a planetary scale. This presentation will introduce open-source packages, data catalogs, and interactive web apps designed to empower users in harnessing the full potential of cloud computing for geospatial analysis. These user-friendly and accessible tools enable researchers, students, and environmental professionals to explore and analyze satellite data for diverse environmental applications.
