          Workshop: “Application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle System in
          Geoinformatics for Sustainable Development”
        </h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          There will be two parts to this workshop. The first part will be
          conducted by Onyeukwu Nnadozie Uzoma. He will introduce the
          participants to the essential and basic flight control systems and
          rules, flight planning, and data collection techniques. Then, under
          his guidance, the participants will receive a hands-on experience in
          operating drones. The second part will be conducted by Nyi Nyi Nyan
          Lin. Participants will learn techniques for creating orthophotos,
          digital surface models, digital terrain models, point clouds, and 3D
          models from UAV images using photogrammetry techniques from him. The
          workshop will conclude with a session of segmenting resulting data (in
          2D and/or 3D), where participants will be guided on carrying out
          segmentation to extract building footprints and other relevant
          information essential for the implementation of sustainable
          development initiatives.

          Workshop: “Semi-supervised Learning for Aerial Scene Classification
          with Deep Learning”
        </h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          In this workshop, participants will delve into the exciting world of
          geoscience and Remote Sensing (RS) applications using state-of-the-art
          semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms. The main aim is to
          demonstrate how available semi-supervised learning algorithms can
          effectively classify aerial scenes even with as few as 4, 20, or 40
          labelled examples per class, achieving comparable accuracies to models
          trained with lots of labelled examples. The workshop leader will
          showcase the power of SSL algorithms in leveraging both labelled and
          unlabelled data, enabling efficient scene classification without the
          need for extensive annotations.
          <br />
          This workshop is designed for researchers, practitioners, and
          enthusiasts in the fields of geoscience, Remote Sensing, and deep
          learning. Whether you are a seasoned expert or just starting your
          journey in deep learning, this workshop caters to all levels of
          expertise.

        <h4 style="color: #0c2138; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">WORKSHOP: <br>Open data and models for mapping ecosystem services 
        </h4> 
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Ecosystem services (ES) are the benefits provided to humans by the natural environment, such as clean air, natural pollination, drought regulation, food from agriculture, climate regulation, etc. Providing Information about ES for decision-making is essential to preserve their supply and, consequently, their benefits to society. Making these services visible through the mapping of biophysical, social and economic indicators enables understanding of potential trade-offs and the design of conservation strategies. The provision of ES is influenced by land cover changes (LCC) and efficient land use planning is required for maintaining ES flow. Land use planning can be supported by ES-based modelling tools to estimate ES supply based on land cover. In this workshop we explore available open data and models which can be used for ES modelling and mapping. A hands-on exercise using an InVEST model will be carried out.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
            This workshop will provide a perspective on existing open datasets and models to work with ES. It will also promote the importance of the ecosystem services concept for sustainability and human well-being through the results obtained for FCT ASEBIO project (PTDC/CTA-AMB/28438/2017, https://asebio.novaims.unl.pt). In the end of this workshop, participants will:
            <ul>
                <li>Understand the ES concept and its importance for human well-being;</li>
                <li>Know where to find open datasets and models (e.g. InVEST) for assessing ES with GIS;</li>
                <li>Learn how to calculate ES indicators using InVEST.</li>
