          WORKSHOP: <br />Environmental Citizen Science with senseBox and
          openSenseMap
        </div>
        <div class="keynote-description">
          In this workshop participants will learn about environmental citizen
          science using the modular sensor platform senseBox and the open
          citizen science data infrastructure openSenseMap. The senseBox is a
          DIY Citizen Science toolkit for local and mobile measurement of
          environmental data such as temperature, humidity, air pressure,
          illuminance, UV light or air quality. It can be connected to the
          internet via WiFi, Ethernet or LoRa to enable Internet of Things
          capabilities in a sensor network. Local workshop participants will
          build and code measurement devices on several environmental phenomena
          and collect data around the campus. Remote participants will learn to
          access and analyze data from the openSenseMap through its APIs and
          other external tools. At the end environmental geodata from the local
          experiment will be analyzed by the whole group. We will round up with
          a discussion on the potential of the senseBox and openSenseMap in
          research projects and for educational purposes in secondary and higher
          education, while focusing on the data and computational, scientific
          and spatial literacy.

          WORKSHOP: <br />Open data and models for mapping ecosystem services
        </div>
        <div class="keynote-description">
          Ecosystem services (ES) are the benefits provided to humans by the
          natural environment, such as clean air, natural pollination, drought
          regulation, food from agriculture, climate regulation, etc. Providing
          Information about ES for decision-making is essential to preserve
          their supply and, consequently, their benefits to society. Making
          these services visible through the mapping of biophysical, social and
          economic indicators enables understanding of potential trade-offs and
          the design of conservation strategies. The provision of ES is
          influenced by land cover changes (LCC) and efficient land use planning
          is required for maintaining ES flow. Land use planning can be
          supported by ES-based modelling tools to estimate ES supply based on
          land cover. In this workshop we explore available open data and models
          which can be used for ES modelling and mapping. A hands-on exercise
          using an InVEST model will be carried out.
