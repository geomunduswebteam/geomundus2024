                        We all need sufficient, affordable, and nutritious food to achieve food security. Food security depends on well-functioning food systems which in turn depend on many environmental, social, and economic factors that are often interconnected. Ensuring future food security is one of the grand challenges of our time because it requires changes to many parts of society from global to local levels, such as

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                         Our planet is in dire straits. Several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals address problems resulting from climate change and rising greenhouse gas emissions. The constant growth of urban mobility and transport has led to a dramatic increase in these emissions. In order to ensure livable environments for future generations, it will be necessary to reduce our CO2 footprint. Spatial decision-making fueled by spatial data science contributes to this effort in major ways, supported by recent progress regarding the availability of spatial big data, computational methods and geospatial technologies. This presentation will demonstrate why spatial decision-making is essential for sustainability and how spatial data science provides methods to perform large-scale spatio-temporal analyses of mobility patterns as well as geospatial technologies for changing people's mobility behavior. Examples will cover movement data analysis within the context of multi-modal and energy-efficient mobility, smart charging of electric vehicles, and mobile decision-making support.

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">There's a lot of uncertainty on what is going to be the future for developers and developer tooling. Are low code or even no code frameworks going to replace full developers? Is AI going to take our jobs? How do we know which trend is the right one that we should jump in? Are we reinventing the wheel? In this talk, we will try to summarize the current state of the art on developer tooling and make an educated guess on what would be our best bet. Should we be worried or is this the advent of a bright new future?</p>

                            Satellite data are critical for a wide range of environmental applications. In the past, access to satellite data was limited to researchers and professionals with expertise in remote sensing and image processing. However, with the increasing availability of open-access satellite data and cloud-computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine, Microsoft Planetary Computer, and Amazon Web Services, anyone can now gain insight into environmental changes on a planetary scale. This presentation will introduce open-source packages, data catalogs, and interactive web apps designed to empower users in harnessing the full potential of cloud computing for geospatial analysis. These user-friendly and accessible tools enable researchers, students, and environmental professionals to explore and analyze satellite data for diverse environmental applications.

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                         Our planet is in dire straits. Several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals address problems resulting from climate change and rising greenhouse gas emissions. The constant growth of urban mobility and transport has led to a dramatic increase in these emissions. In order to ensure livable environments for future generations, it will be necessary to reduce our CO2 footprint. Spatial decision-making fueled by spatial data science contributes to this effort in major ways, supported by recent progress regarding the availability of spatial big data, computational methods and geospatial technologies. This presentation will demonstrate why spatial decision-making is essential for sustainability and how spatial data science provides methods to perform large-scale spatio-temporal analyses of mobility patterns as well as geospatial technologies for changing people's mobility behavior. Examples will cover movement data analysis within the context of multi-modal and energy-efficient mobility, smart charging of electric vehicles, and mobile decision-making support.

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        Since the 2010s there has been a shift in the nature and quantity of digital data on social processes flowing into both research and policy. Much of this data stems from sensing and monitoring through GIS and related technologies, whether using people themselves as sensors (as with mobile phone location data) or using classic forms of sensing in new ways (such as satellite data for migration monitoring, or social media data for development policy). New forms of data such as those stemming from fintech, from ID systems around the world, and other sources promise to broaden the uses and potential abuses of people’s digital traces. The new data provides what Pentland (2012) has termed ‘the god’s eye view’ – but to whose benefit, and in whose interests? There are two views on this in the world of research. First, do the new sources provide better-quality data, do they add something to the analysis of social phenomena, can they enable policy and research to do a better job of serving society? The second view asks how these data sources become available, whose interests they serve, and what this means for their legitimacy, and the legitimacy of research and policy based on them. This presentation will explore the tensions between these two views, and ask how these new sources of geospatial data interact with questions of rights, ethics and politics.

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        In this workshop, participants will delve into the exciting world of geoscience and Remote Sensing (RS) applications using state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms. The main aim is to demonstrate how available semi-supervised learning algorithms can effectively classify aerial scenes even with as few as 4, 20, or 40 labelled examples per class, achieving comparable accuracies to models trained with lots of labelled examples. The workshop leader will showcase the power of SSL algorithms in leveraging both labelled and unlabelled data, enabling efficient scene classification without the need for extensive annotations.

The Hub started from YouTube videos to free webinars and now to highly affordable online courses. The learning content caters to beginners, intermediates, and professionals. Currently, Babatunde is an MSc student in Geospatial Technologies at the Universitat Jaume I (Spain) and the University of Münster (Germany). He is an active actor in the regional and Global Geospatial Community and has been included in the <a href="https://www.geospatialworld.net/rising-stars/2023/">Top 50 Rising Stars of the Geospatial World Forum</a>.

            <h4 style="color: #0c2138; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">WORKSHOP: <br>Open data and models for mapping ecosystem services 
            </h4> 
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                Ecosystem services (ES) are the benefits provided to humans by the natural environment, such as clean air, natural pollination, drought regulation, food from agriculture, climate regulation, etc. Providing Information about ES for decision-making is essential to preserve their supply and, consequently, their benefits to society. Making these services visible through the mapping of biophysical, social and economic indicators enables understanding of potential trade-offs and the design of conservation strategies. The provision of ES is influenced by land cover changes (LCC) and efficient land use planning is required for maintaining ES flow. Land use planning can be supported by ES-based modelling tools to estimate ES supply based on land cover. In this workshop we explore available open data and models which can be used for ES modelling and mapping. A hands-on exercise using an InVEST model will be carried out.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                This workshop will provide a perspective on existing open datasets and models to work with ES. It will also promote the importance of the ecosystem services concept for sustainability and human well-being through the results obtained for FCT ASEBIO project (PTDC/CTA-AMB/28438/2017, https://asebio.novaims.unl.pt). In the end of this workshop, participants will:
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand the ES concept and its importance for human well-being;</li>
                    <li>Know where to find open datasets and models (e.g. InVEST) for assessing ES with GIS;</li>
                    <li>Learn how to calculate ES indicators using InVEST.</li>
                </ul>  
            </p>
