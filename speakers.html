                    <p class= "keynote-content">
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        The launch of GRASS GIS in 1984 marked the beginning of open-source geospatial software. After four decades, this talk highlights major progress in the field 
                        and provides a vision of upcoming trends. FOSS4G developers need to find a middle ground between standardisation and innovation. Whether de facto or de jure, 
                        standards establish a solid foundation for shared use and collaboration. Solid theory serves as the basis for successful standards. OGC’s Simple Features, 
                        using DE-9IM, has influenced the success of PostGIS, sf in R, and GeoPandas in Python. The backbone of GDAL includes standards like GeoTIFF and JPEG 2000. 
                        Thanks to these standards, commercial and institutional users have widely adopted tools like PostGIS, GDAL, and R-sf.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        As a result of this virtuous cycle, vector-based FOSS4G is now in stasis. On the other hand, raster-based GIS is overflowing with innovation. 
                        Petabytes of open Earth observation (EO) data are now available. The exploration of space-borne sensors leads to significant innovation. 
                        However, no established theory exists for modelling and analysing big EO data. This situation has led to largely incompatible developments, including GeoPandas,
                         Open Data Cube, OpenEO, and R-sits. Collaboration is necessary among developers of FOSS for big EO data analytics to avoid a winner-takes-all competition. 
                         This talk will conclude with an example of cooperation between the OpenEO and R-sits systems.

                Workshop: “Vegetation Indexes Extraction by using Sentinel Hub API”
              </h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                This workshop will provide a comprehensive guide to extracting vegetation indexes using the Sentinel Hub API. 
                Participants will start by learning how to access satellite imagery through the API and configure custom scripts for index calculation. 
                The workshop will cover key vegetation indexes such as NDVI, GCI, and SAVI, demonstrating how to automate their extraction across different 
                time periods and geographic locations. Attendees will also learn techniques for batch processing large datasets and visualizing vegetation 
                trends over time. Sentinel Hub API is a powerful cloud-based platform that provides seamless access to Copernicus Sentinel satellite data, 
                enabling users to retrieve and analyze multispectral imagery efficiently. With advanced capabilities for custom scripting and on-demand data 
                processing, Sentinel Hub is an useful tool for monitoring vegetation health, tracking agricultural progress, and studying environmental changes 
                globally.
                <br />
                This workshop is designed for researchers, environmental scientists, data analysts, GIS specialists, and developers interested in 
                vegetation monitoring and remote sensing using the Sentinel Hub API. It is also ideal for educators and students in environmental science, 
                agronomy, and geography.

              <p style="text-align: justify">
                Air pollution is the world’s largest environmental health risk, contributing to 7 million premature deaths globally each year, and poor people in 
                developing countries are the most heavily affected. Low-cost IoT sensor networks on the ground have the potential to close the climate data gaps in sub-Saharan Africa, 
                but networks are expensive to implement and maintain in African cities.
                Satellite-derived PM2.5 estimates based on Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and machine learning techniques can be used to estimate pollution levels over large areas 
                to help develop interventions such as vulnerability risk profiles for urban spaces, health preservation and environmental protection for affected populations, 
                as well as community empowerment, and climate change mitigation.

                In the first half of the workshop, we will introduce the Clean Codes Principles. 
                In the second half, we will analyze a toy example of a GIS application. 
                The toy example will be a web app that displays a comparison between two point 
                clouds. The goal is to clean the code by applying the principles that will be 
                presented.

                Workshop: “Developing an Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MapLibre GL JS”
              </h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                Dashboard development is becoming increasingly important. Decision-makers often interact
                more effectively with dashboards compared to static maps. Dashboards can convey
                information more quickly and interactively, providing intelligent insights. For example, how
                many people are affected by poor air quality yearly in your country? Which areas have lower
                coverage of monitoring stations? These questions and many more can be answered with a
                dashboard. More importantly, dashboards can be updated more frequently and in real-time
                compared to static maps.
                Additionally, acquiring skills in development is critical for job security, especially as more
                organizations demand GIS professionals with programming experiences. If you're someone
                who wants to gain technical skills and create products that can enhance your portfolio, then
                this workshop is for you.
                In this workshop, we will develop an Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard from scratch using
                MapLibre GL JS, JavaScript/TypeScript, and other open-source libraries. We will
                explore how to connect real-time data sources to provide real-time air quality monitoring. We
                will also add interactivity and summary statistics, integrating beautiful charts and metrics to
                drive decision-making.
                Finally, the concept that will be learned in this workshop will be adaptable to developing
                dashboards for other climate change metrics, or other WebGIS development tasks in
                general.
                <br><br>
                <u>Workshop Goals:</u>

              </h4> 
              <p style="text-align:justify;">
                  Ecosystem services (ES) are the benefits provided to humans by the natural environment, such as clean air, natural pollination, drought regulation, food from agriculture, climate regulation, etc. Providing Information about ES for decision-making is essential to preserve their supply and, consequently, their benefits to society. Making these services visible through the mapping of biophysical, social and economic indicators enables understanding of potential trade-offs and the design of conservation strategies. The provision of ES is influenced by land cover changes (LCC) and efficient land use planning is required for maintaining ES flow. Land use planning can be supported by ES-based modelling tools to estimate ES supply based on land cover. In this workshop we explore available open data and models which can be used for ES modelling and mapping. A hands-on exercise using an InVEST model will be carried out.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align:justify;">
                  This workshop will provide a perspective on existing open datasets and models to work with ES. It will also promote the importance of the ecosystem services concept for sustainability and human well-being through the results obtained for FCT ASEBIO project (PTDC/CTA-AMB/28438/2017, https://asebio.novaims.unl.pt). In the end of this workshop, participants will:
                  <ul>
                      <li>Understand the ES concept and its importance for human well-being;</li>
                      <li>Know where to find open datasets and models (e.g. InVEST) for assessing ES with GIS;</li>
                      <li>Learn how to calculate ES indicators using InVEST.</li>
